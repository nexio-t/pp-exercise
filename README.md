# Pathpoint exercise

## Getting started 
At the root of the directory, run: 
```sh
npm i 
```
To run a sample file, you can use the one provided or provide your own. For example: 
```sh
node index.js score_recs.js 3 
```
returns the top 3 high scores. 
## Errors and JSON 
You can also attempt to run the file with a JSON error: 
```sh
node index.js score_recs_err.js 3 
```
which should return an error. Or run without any arguments or with just a file name or count: 
```sh
node index.js 
```
which should return an appropriate error response.
